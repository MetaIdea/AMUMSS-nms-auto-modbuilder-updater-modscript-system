# In each one of them you can either specify a default value or put 'ask'.
# Any option with a value of ask will result in the builder to ask you the question during the build process.

# Possible Values:
# combine = ask, none, simple, composite, numericSuffix
# copy =  ask, none, all, some

# All the other options are flags with possible values of: ask, true, false
